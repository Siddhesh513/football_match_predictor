# Football Match Predictor

A modular machine learning system for predicting football match outcomes using advanced statistical analysis and multiple ML algorithms.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Algorithm Approach**: Implements multiple machine learning models including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Processes historical match data with feature engineering and statistical analysis
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean, maintainable code structure with separate modules for data processing, model training, and prediction
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed model evaluation with accuracy, F1-score, and cross-validation metrics
- **Real-time Predictions**: Make predictions for upcoming matches based on team statistics and historical performance

## 📊 Supported Predictions

- **Home Win (H)**: Probability of home team victory
- **Away Win (A)**: Probability of away team victory  
- **Draw (D)**: Probability of match ending in a draw

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: Numerical computations
- **matplotlib/seaborn**: Data visualization
- **joblib**: Model serialization

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Siddhesh513/football_match_predictor.git
   cd football_match_predictor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the predictor**
   ```bash
   python src/predictor.py
   ```

## 📈 Usage

### Making Predictions

```python
from src.predictor import FootballPredictor

# Initialize the predictor
predictor = FootballPredictor()

# Make a prediction
home_team = "Manchester United"
away_team = "Liverpool"
prediction = predictor.predict_match(home_team, away_team)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
# Output: {'Home Win': 0.45, 'Draw': 0.25, 'Away Win': 0.30}
```

### Training New Models

```python
from src.model_training import train_models

# Train models with new data
train_models(data_path="data/processed/matches.csv")
```

## 🎯 Model Performance

| Model | Accuracy | F1-Score | Training Time |
|-------|----------|----------|---------------|
| Random Forest | 52.3% | 0.51 | 2.4s |
| Logistic Regression | 49.8% | 0.48 | 0.8s |
| Gradient Boosting | 54.1% | 0.53 | 5.2s |

## 📊 Data Sources

The system uses historical match data including:
- Match results (Home/Draw/Away)
- Team statistics (goals, shots, possession)
- Head-to-head records
- Recent form analysis
- Home/away performance metrics

## 🔧 Configuration

Modify `config.py` to customize:
- Model parameters
- Feature selection
- Data preprocessing options
- Output formats
